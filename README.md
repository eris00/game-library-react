## Notes

- The backend is a dummy REST API ([dummyjson.com/products](https://dummyjson.com/products)), so all changes are temporary and reset on reload.
- This project was developed as a final assignment for a React Frontend course at CortexAcademy — focus is on clean code, architecture, and modern frontend best practices.
